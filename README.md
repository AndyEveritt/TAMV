# TAMV
TAMV = Tool Align Machine Vision for Duet based tool changing 3D printers.

* Runs on the Pi that has the USB camera (Sorry, no PiCam at this moment)
* Requires network connection to DUET RepRap V2 or V3 based printer.
* Requires OpenCV installed on the Pi.  
  * See https://github.com/DanalEstes/installOpenCV for one way to install OpenCV

Still very much in development as of 19 Mar 2020.
* At this time, it will show you tools, and machine vision center them
* It does not, yet, calculate G10 commands.
